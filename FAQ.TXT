GROUP-OFFICE FAQ

1. Can I upload big files?
	Yes you can. With the Java upload applet you can upload large files without changing the PHP 
	configuration. It will send files in 1 MB chunks.
	
	For the regular HTTP upload some changes in php.ini are required for this:
	
	post_max_size = ??M
	file_uploads = On
	upload_max_filesize = ??M
	
	for apache's module config: conf.d/php.conf:
	
	limit_request_body = ?? 
	
	Also if the upload is taking a long time you should set the connection timeout from your webserver 
	to a higher value. For apache (httpd.conf):
	
	Timeout ???
	
	Also check for Proxy server limits
	

2. Can I create folders and filters with POP-3 servers?
	No you can't. Multiple folders and filters are only supported with IMAP servers.
	 
3. Why do I get this error when i use the e-mail module?
   'Error: the imap extension for PHP is not installed' or 
   'Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imap_utf7_encode() in ../classes/imap.class.inc on line 33'
   	
   	You didn't compile imap in PHP this is required for both IMAP and POP3.

4. Why do I instantly get an access denied error when I open the file manager?
	Because the home directories from the users are not writable for the webserver. The home directories are located
	in the path you entered where Group-Office should store files. The default setting is /home/groupoffice.
	The directory groupoffice should be owned by the webserver user and the directory home should be 
	accessible (executable).

5. After installation I can't change the ownership of config.php and it won't start. What can I do?
	You can donwload Group-Office.php with FTP, delete it from the server and upload it back.
		
6. Why can' t I connect to Cyrus? It gives me a cross-realm error.
	Try these settings:
		allowplaintext:yes;
		sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
		sasl_minimum_layer:0

7. I've put my config file in /etc/groupoffice/../.... But when I access Group-Office
	with different URL's it sometimes doesn't find the config file.
	
	You need to set: "UseCanonicalName On" in httpd.conf of apache. This way
	it always uses the same name.

9. How to install PECL fileinfo extension?

Do not do this on a production machine. This will install development tools that do not belong on a

pecl install Fileinfo
Add "extension=fileinfo.so" to php.ini (/etc/php5/{cli,cgi}/php.ini)
